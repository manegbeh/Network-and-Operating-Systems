    "## The Internet Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Internet Layer** is responsible for the logical addressing and routing of data packets across different networks.\n",
    "It enables communication between devices across geographically distributed networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Responsibilities:\n",
    "1. **Logical Addressing**: Assigns unique IP addresses to devices.\n",
    "2. **Routing**: Determines the best path for packets to reach their destination.\n",
    "3. **Packetization**: Encapsulates transport-layer segments into **IP datagrams**.\n",
    "4. **Fragmentation & Reassembly**: Splits large packets to fit network constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main protocol at this layer is **IP (Internet Protocol)**, which can be IPv4 or IPv6.\n"

    "## IP Addressing and Hierarchical Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "IP addresses are used to uniquely identify devices on a network. They are structured hierarchically.\n",

    "- **Dotted-Decimal Notation**: (e.g., `192.168.1.1` → `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001` in binary)\n",
    "- **Address Classes**:\n",
    "  - **Class A**: Large networks (`0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255`)\n",
    "  - **Class B**: Medium networks (`128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255`)\n",
    "  - **Class C**: Small networks (`192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255`)\n",
    "  - **Class D (Multicast)**: `224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255`\n",
    "  - **Class E (Experimental)**: `240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Private vs Public IPs**\n",
    "- **Private IPs**: Reserved for internal networks (`10.0.0.0/8`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `172.16.0.0/12`)\n",
    "- **Public IPs**: Routable across the internet.\n"

    "\n",
    "DHCP dynamically assigns **IP addresses** to devices on a network.\n",

    "1. **DHCP Discover**: Client broadcasts a request for an IP address.\n",
    "2. **DHCP Offer**: Server responds with an available IP.\n",
    "3. **DHCP Request**: Client requests to use the offered IP.\n",
    "4. **DHCP Acknowledgment**: Server confirms and assigns the IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "DHCP enables **plug-and-play** networking and supports mobile users dynamically.\n"

    "\n",
    "NAT allows multiple devices in a private network to share a **single public IP address** when accessing the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of NAT:**\n",
    "- **Static NAT**: Maps one private IP to one public IP.\n",
    "- **Dynamic NAT**: Maps a private IP to any available public IP.\n",
    "- **PAT (Port Address Translation)**: Multiple private IPs share one public IP using unique port numbers.\n",

    "### **Subnetting Basics**\n",
    "Subnetting allows dividing a network into smaller sub-networks to optimize routing and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Subnet Mask Calculation:**\n",
    "- Subnet masks determine the network and host portions of an IP address.\n",
    "- Example: A `/26` subnet (`255.255.255.192`) provides **4 subnets** with **62 usable host addresses**.\n",

    "|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n",
