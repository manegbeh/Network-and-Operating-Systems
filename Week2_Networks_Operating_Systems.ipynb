    "Topics covered include:\n",
    "- Application layer principles\n",
    "- Web and HTTP fundamentals\n",

    "\n",
    "The **application layer** is the topmost layer in the network stack, responsible for providing network services to end users. \n",
    "Key functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data encoding/decoding for communication.\n",
    "- Support for network-based applications like **email, web browsing, file transfers, and video streaming**.\n",
    "- Protocols like **HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, and IMAP** operate at this layer.\n"

    "## Web and HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is the foundation of web communication. It follows a **client-server model**, \n",
    "where a client (browser) requests resources from a web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Characteristics:\n",
    "- **Uses TCP (port 80)** for reliable communication.\n",
    "- **Stateless protocol** (each request is independent).\n",
    "- **Two main message types**: Request and Response.\n"

    "\n",
    "| Method | Description |\n",
    "|--------|------------|\n",
    "| **GET** | Requests a resource without modifying it. |\n",
    "| **POST** | Sends data to be processed by the server (e.g., form submission). |\n",
    "| **PUT** | Updates a resource or creates one if it doesnâ€™t exist. |\n",
    "| **DELETE** | Removes a resource from the server. |\n",
    "| **HEAD** | Requests metadata about a resource. |\n",
    "| **OPTIONS** | Fetches supported HTTP methods for a resource. |\n"

    "| **400 Bad Request** | The request was malformed or invalid. |\n",
    "| **403 Forbidden** | Access denied to the requested resource. |\n",
    "| **404 Not Found** | Resource does not exist. |\n",
    "| **500 Internal Server Error** | The server encountered an unexpected condition. |\n"

    "\n",
    "The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is used to resolve human-readable domain names into IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How DNS Works:\n",
    "1. A client requests the IP address of a domain (e.g., `www.google.com`).\n",
    "2. The DNS resolver queries different levels of DNS servers.\n",
    "3. The authoritative DNS server provides the IP address.\n",
    "4. The client uses this IP to connect to the web server.\n"
