    "- Connectionless transport: UDP\n",

    "## The Transport Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The **transport layer** is responsible for end-to-end communication and data transfer between applications. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logical communication between application processes.\n",
    "- **Multiplexing and demultiplexing** to handle multiple connections.\n",
    "- **Reliable data transfer** through error detection and retransmission (TCP).\n",
    "- **Flow control** to manage sender-receiver speed differences.\n",
    "- **Congestion control** to avoid network overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two main transport-layer protocols:\n",
    "1. **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** – Reliable, connection-oriented communication.\n",
    "2. **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** – Unreliable, connectionless communication.\n"
