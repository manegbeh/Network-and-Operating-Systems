    "## What is an Operating System?\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources while providing common services for programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Functions of an OS:**\n",
    "1. **Process Management:** Handles process scheduling, execution, and termination.\n",
    "2. **Memory Management:** Allocates and deallocates memory for processes.\n",
    "3. **File System Management:** Organizes and provides access to files.\n",
    "4. **I/O Device Management:** Manages communication with peripheral devices.\n",
    "5. **Security & Access Control:** Ensures system security and user authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular OS examples: **Windows, macOS, Linux, Unix, Android, iOS**.\n"

    "## Memory Hierarchy & Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The OS manages **primary memory (RAM)** and **secondary storage (HDD/SSD)** to optimize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Memory Hierarchy:**\n",
    "| Memory Type | Speed | Cost | Volatility |\n",
    "|-------------|------|------|------------|\n",
    "| **Registers** | Fastest | Highest | Volatile |\n",
    "| **Cache (L1, L2, L3)** | Very Fast | High | Volatile |\n",
    "| **RAM (Main Memory)** | Fast | Moderate | Volatile |\n",
    "| **SSD/HDD (Storage)** | Slow | Low | Non-volatile |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Memory Management Techniques:**\n",
    "- **Paging**: Divides memory into fixed-sized blocks.\n",
    "- **Segmentation**: Divides memory into variable-sized blocks.\n",
    "- **Virtual Memory**: Uses disk space as an extension of RAM.\n"

    "## Process Management & Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "A **process** is a running program, and the OS handles multiple processes using scheduling algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Scheduling:**\n",
    "1. **Short-term scheduling:** Decides which process gets CPU time.\n",
    "2. **Medium-term scheduling:** Swaps processes between memory and disk.\n",
    "3. **Long-term scheduling:** Controls which processes enter the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Scheduling Algorithms:**\n",
    "- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**: Processes execute in arrival order.\n",
    "- **Round Robin (RR)**: Each process gets a fixed time slice.\n",
    "- **Shortest Job Next (SJN)**: Executes shortest processes first.\n",
    "- **Priority Scheduling**: Higher priority processes execute first.\n"

    "## File Systems & Storage Management\n",
    "\n",
    "An OS organizes data using **file systems**, which define how files are stored and accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common File Systems:**\n",
    "- **NTFS** (Windows) - Secure & supports large files.\n",
    "- **FAT32** (USB devices) - Compatible but limited file sizes.\n",
    "- **ext4** (Linux) - Optimized for performance and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Storage Management:**\n",
    "- **Disk Partitioning:** Divides storage into sections.\n",
    "- **File Allocation Tables (FAT):** Maps file locations on disk.\n",
    "- **Journaling:** Logs changes before committing them to disk (prevents corruption).\n"
