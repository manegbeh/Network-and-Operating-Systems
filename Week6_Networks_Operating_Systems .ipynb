    "## The Network Access Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Network Access Layer** (also called the Link Layer) is responsible for delivering data **between physically connected devices**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Responsibilities:**\n",
    "- **Framing:** Encapsulating data into frames.\n",
    "- **Error Detection:** Identifying corrupted frames (CRC, checksums).\n",
    "- **Flow Control:** Regulating data transmission between sender and receiver.\n",
    "- **Medium Access Control (MAC):** Handling shared channel access (Ethernet, WiFi).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Link Layer operates at **Layer 2** in the OSI Model and interacts with both the Network and Physical layers.\n"

    "## MAC (Medium Access Control) Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "**MAC protocols** determine how devices share a **common communication channel** without interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of MAC Protocols:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Channel Partitioning:** Divides the channel into separate resources.\n",
    "   - **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access):** Time slots allocated to devices.\n",
    "   - **FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access):** Different frequency bands assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Access Protocols:** Allow devices to transmit whenever needed, resolving collisions.\n",
    "   - **ALOHA:** Simple, inefficient, transmits whenever data is ready.\n",
    "   - **CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access):** Listens before sending to avoid collisions.\n",
    "   - **CSMA/CD (Collision Detection):** Used in Ethernet; aborts transmission on collision.\n",
    "   - **CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance):** Used in WiFi; avoids collisions proactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Taking Turns Protocols:** Uses controlled access to the channel.\n",
    "   - **Polling:** A central device assigns transmit permissions.\n",
    "   - **Token Passing:** A special packet (token) grants transmission rights.\n"

    "1. A device sends an **ARP Request** (`Who has 192.168.1.1?`).\n",
